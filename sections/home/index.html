      Who am I?

    <p>
      My name is Liam Krewer. I'm a {{age}} year old web developer from Galway, Ireland. I studied Computer Engineering in NUIG and graduated with a 1<sup>st</sup> Class Honours Degree in October 2014. Since then I've been working with the local startup <a href="http://www.onepagecrm.com">OnePageCRM<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> as a full stack RoR developer.

      This is my personal website, a place primarily designed as a portfolio and blog, but primarily used to experiment with the latest web technologies on (which is my way of procrastinating while I'm supposed to do the former). I will eventually get around to writing content for my <a href="">blog</a>. Until then do check out my <a href="">profile</a> to see my skills, interests and past achievements.
